# DIY warm floor thermostat with Apple HomeKit support

Device is 5-zone warm floor temperature controller and used to replace 5x Danfoss ECtemp Next Plus programmable regulator (or other thermostats with NTC\PTC sensors).
Total cost is under 100USD with Raspberry Pi 3 model B+.
Device can be used without HomeKit abilities, just remove Raspberry Pi. It will turn device to usual 5-zone manual controlled thermostat.

"PCB Layout Designer 6.0" software needed to open files from PCB folder.
Default (hardcoded in firmware) sensor type is NTC with nominal resistanse = 15KOhm, can be tuned if needed.
PSU used: MeanWell PS-25-5 (out 5V 5A).
Enclosure is "3D-printed" with ABS plastic (hotbed = 90'C, hotend = 238'C, infill = 50%).
